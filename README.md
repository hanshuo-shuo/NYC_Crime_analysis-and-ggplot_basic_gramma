## NYC Victim and Crime analysis
### Dataset

[Data resource](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i?ref=hackernoon.com)

This data set includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) from 2006 to the present. 
I want to see what it is like during the past entire year. So I did a little filter on the website to get the date for the year 2021.
